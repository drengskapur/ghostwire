## Notes

1. Many crypto criteria are N/A because Ghostwire is a Helm chart (IaC), not software that implements cryptography
2. Dynamic analysis uses property-based testing (fuzzing) adapted for Helm templates
3. All security mechanisms documented in SECURITY.md
4. Project is maintained, actively developed, responds to issues
